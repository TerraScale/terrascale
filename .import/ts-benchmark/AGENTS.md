AI IS NOT ALLOWED TO EDIT THIS FILE ONLY HUMANS CAN!

# Rules
- Never add AI attribution to commits, PR titles, or PR descriptions: no `Co-Authored-By:` trailers, no `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` or similar generated-by notices.
- We need to save all benchmarks in an easy to see .md tables so we can compare from the very beginning the difference and improvements
- Benchmarks land as `.md` tables in `bench/`.

## Local CPU Priority

- When building or testing locally, run every build, test, lint, and benchmark
  command at low CPU priority by prefixing it with `nice -n 19` (for example
  `nice -n 19 make test-fast`). Local dev servers and watchers count too.
- In CI (`CI=true`) use full CPU priority: do nothing. Never add `nice` or
  `renice` to CI workflows, Makefiles, scripts, or Containerfiles; the low
  priority is applied by whoever runs the command locally.

## Zero configuration (user decision 2026-10-09, do not revert)

- Every feature is always on. No feature flags, on/off variables, opt-in settings, boolean enabled configuration keys, deploy toggles or kill switches in code, config or CI. Delete switches and their guarded paths.
- Every region always serves. NetBird network membership admits a node automatically; it discovers every region, infers its own region from where it runs and starts serving without a per-region enable step.
- OCI Vault automatically creates, delivers and configures every first-party production secret. Vendor-issued keys (such as Stripe and Cloudflare) are stored once in Vault and picked up automatically; nobody copies secrets by hand.
- Values have one correct setting in code. Expose no tuning knobs. Fakes, demo stores and skip-auth belong only in test code and test binaries.
- CI rejects new switch-style configuration; ts-reviewer requests changes. Only unavoidable third-party names may have a narrow allowance with a one-line reason.

The operating contract requires automatic serving-region discovery; OCI Vault delivers production benchmark credentials. Fakes and synthetic modes belong only in test binaries.

This section is the TS-795 operating contract, not evidence that every runtime
flow has shipped. See [README.md](README.md) for current SDK/qualification gaps.
Existing production switches are inventoried for their owning implementation
threads; documentation changes must not invent APIs or bypass authorization,
tenant scope, registered callbacks, payment consent, or safety guards.
