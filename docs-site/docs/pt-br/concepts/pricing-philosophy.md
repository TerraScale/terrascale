# Usage accounting

TerraScale bills writes and storage. Reads are not billed.

- A committed write counts its changed rows, or each started 4 KiB the database grew, whichever is more. Failed, refused and rolled-back statements count nothing.
- Storage is the stored bytes of your databases, sampled every hour and billed per GB-month above the plan allowance.
- SQL reads count toward a monthly fair use and are never billed.
- Shape reads served from the edge are free and never counted.

Every plan has a hard monthly write cap, so usage cannot run away. See [pricing](/pt-br/pricing) for each plan's numbers.
