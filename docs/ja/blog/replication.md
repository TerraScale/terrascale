# Choosing durability across Regions (draft)

> Draft. The required guarantees still need production qualification.

Choose database Regions according to your users and residency requirements.
The placement is immutable and applies to backups, restores, exports, and
branches as well as ordinary database storage.

RegionalDurable acknowledges durability within the accepting Region;
GlobalDurable requires every selected Region and the write’s causal
dependencies. A stronger acknowledgement may be unavailable during an outage.
The [replication guide](/ja/concepts/replication) explains sessions, uncertainty,
and the limits of cross-Region conflict resolution. Neither option promises
linearizable reads or global uniqueness.

Selected Regions multiply write units and logical storage before included
allowances. Review [pricing](/ja/pricing/) before choosing placement.
