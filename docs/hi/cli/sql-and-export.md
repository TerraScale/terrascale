# CLI SQL shell and document exports

`ts shell example` starts in relational mode. Enter multiline SQL, then `.run` on its own line to submit the **entire buffer**. Semicolons in strings, comments and trigger bodies are preserved; the shell does not split them. Each relational submission is one request/transaction; transactions do not span submissions.

`.reset` discards pending SQL; `.mode document` selects the read-only collection SELECT subset and `.mode relational` returns to tables. Reset or submit before switching modes. `.help` shows commands; `.quit` exits. EOF or `.quit` with an unsubmitted buffer fails. Up/Down recalls up to 500 submitted statements in memory; history is never written to disk.

```sh
ts exec example - < query.sql
printf 'SELECT 1 AS n;\n.run\n.quit\n' | ts --json shell example
```

`exec` executes one relational statement; `sql` queries the limited read-only document SQL subset. Both accept `-` for stdin. JSON document SQL includes `matched` and `truncated`; relational JSON preserves positional rows and columns, including duplicate column names. See [SQL concepts](../concepts/sql).

Shell JSON emits one typed result record per successful `.run`, then the [complete/error terminal](./automation). Prompts/help/diagnostics go to stderr. Any SQL failure makes the final exit nonzero even if later statements succeed; interruption or pending input cannot produce complete.

`ts export example` writes raw `{collection,id,document}` NDJSON for **live documents only**, compatible with server NDJSON import. `ts --json export example` wraps those records and adds the common terminal contract; those envelopes are not import input.
Stored SQL rows and migration records can appear as document representations with their original keys. Importing those records does not recreate relational table definitions or constraints. Exports exclude empty collections, schemas, indexes, TTL, functions and other metadata. One request reads one document snapshot; separate requests/resumptions read new snapshots. Use [backups](../guides/backups-and-restore) for recovery, not a document export as a full database backup.

Write to a new private partial file and publish it only after exit 0; preserve existing backups and discard partial exports on failure. For JSON, also require a complete terminal record. Output failure never guarantees that an earlier import or SQL write was rolled back.

See [access and consent](./access) before importing into a new database.
